## Features

- Flutter Calculator supports the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, square root, power, factorial, logarithm, trigonometry, and more.

- Flutter Calculator uses the math_expressions library to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions, and the flutter_simple_calculator widget to create a user-friendly interface with interactive buttons.
